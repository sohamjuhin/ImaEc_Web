# ImaEc_Web
Image Encryption web  tool 


===========================================================
Create Server-side Code (app.js):
In the server folder, create an app.js file to set up the Node.js server.
Set up an Express server to handle HTTP requests.
Define a route to handle the image encryption process.

_______________________

Create Client-side Code (index.html, script.js, style.css):
In the public folder, create an index.html file for the user interface.
Create a script.js file for handling user interactions and communicating with the server.
Create a style.css file for styling the user interface.

-----------------------


Run the Application:
Start the server by running the command: node server/app.js.
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the image encryption web tool.
Upload an image, enter a password, and click the "Encrypt Image" button.
The encrypted image will be displayed in the console log.

******************************************
Remember that this example is for educational purposes and lacks many security features, error handling, and optimizations that a production-ready web tool should have. Additionally, encryption and security are complex topics, and implementing a secure and robust encryption system requires careful consideration of various factors and best practices.
